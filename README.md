## üßë‚Äçüíª Develop Locally

This guide provides the necessary steps to set up the **Auth Service** database and run the application using IntelliJ
IDEA.

### 1. Clone and Configure

- Clone the Repository.

- Create Environment File (`.env`):
  Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project and populate it with the following environment
  variables:
    - DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/auth_db
    - DB_USER=db_user
    - DB_PASSWORD=db_password
    - JWT_SECRET=****** Add your secret here ****

Gradle will read these variables on build time and use them for flyway migration and jOOQ generation.

### 2. Start the Database

1. Run `docker-compose up -d` to spin up the development database.

2. Run `docker ps` to confirm that the database container is up and running.

### 3. Run the Application

1. Using `IntelliJ` run `AuthApplication.kt`

2. Verify the migration was done successfully: connect to the PostgreSQL instance using a database client (e.g., DBeaver
   or psql) with the credentials from your `.env` file and double-check the tables were created successfully. Migration
   files live in `/resources/db/migration/`
